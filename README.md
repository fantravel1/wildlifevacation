## 🧠 Core Philosophy

WildlifeVacation is **not a booking marketplace**.  
It is a **species-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- synthesize species-location relationships
- generate itineraries from verified components
- translate ecological content
- cluster sightings and seasons

Humans are required to:
- validate animal welfare standards
- review conservation impact
- approve operator inclusion
- prevent misinformation

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

The site is built around **biological and experiential entities**.

### Core Entities
- Animal Species
- Destination
- Habitat / Biome
- Experience Type
- Itinerary
- Operator / Service
- Seasonality Window
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links biologically and geographically
- is programmatically generatable
